Hello, there! I am an MS student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu), advised by [Dr. Xuan Wang](https://xuanwang91.github.io/). 
My research interests are in the field of Multimodal ML and Bio-medical applications.

I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Indian institute of Technology, Bombay ([IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)).

Prior to VT, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist with 4.5 years of experience in Big Data and Machine Learning. In my role at a [multinational AI company](https://fractal.ai/), I worked with Fortune 500 companies like P&G (Consumer Goods), IdeaForge (Drone Technology), Sky (Telecom Media), DLG (Insurance), and Visa (Financial Services). My work involved leveraging their structured/unstructured data to build intelligent AI systems using cutting-edge machine learning & deep learning frameworks.
