Hello, there! I am an **MS student (Thesis Track)** in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu) (VT), advised by [Dr. Xuan Wang](https://xuanwang91.github.io/). 
I am also a member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) at VT.
My primary research interests are in the field of AI for Healthcare. I am currently working on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for  biomedical sequences.

I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (CS) from Indian institute of Technology, Bombay ([IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)).

Prior to VT, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist with 4.5 years of experience in Big Data and Machine Learning. In my role at a [multinational AI company](https://fractal.ai/), I worked with Fortune 500 companies like P&G (Consumer Goods), IdeaForge (Drone Technology), Sky (Telecom Media), DLG (Insurance), and Visa (Financial Services). My work involved leveraging their structured/unstructured data to build intelligent AI systems using cutting-edge machine learning & deep learning frameworks.

* **[2024.4]** Thrilled for being awarded the **AnitaB.org Advancing Inclusion Scholarship** to attend the **Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) 2024**! This prestigious scholarship will allow me to participate in the worldâ€™s largest gathering of women and non-binary technologists 
* **[2024.3]** Check out our new survey paper on [LLMs for diverse biomedical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15673)! We explored three critical categories of biomedical data: 1) textual data (biomedical literature and health records), 2) biological sequences (DNA/RNA/protein sequences and multi-omics sequencing data), and 3) brain signals (time-series EEG data).
